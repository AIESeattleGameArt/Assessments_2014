Anime Ranger Game Asset: Character Sprint December 2013 
Academy of Interactive Entertainment
Patrick Ryan

The character design I chose for the assignment was born of the necessity to fill a stylistic hole in my portfolio. I have admired the anime inspired work of studios like Ankama employ on titles such as Wakfu, Dofus, and Krosmaster Arena. To round out my portfolio, I embraced the abstract style of anime art, translating that into a 3D medium while trying to stay true to the common themes that the style embraces. Most anime art emphasizes style over functionality in terms of clothing, so I tried to bring that aesthetic into my character. The extra straps and signature scarf are details that help ground the style, while serving very little real purpose and offer the character no protection. The character wears light armor to allow freedom of movement for combat. The use of a double bladed spear allows for dynamic combat animations that go farther than a single bladed spear.
