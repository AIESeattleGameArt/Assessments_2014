	I came up with a more hyperstylized look in my concpet art giving her long narrower features.  I went for a dark yet beautiful look. In my model I attepted to mimic my art style in stylized ways, lengthening the body and keeping cartoonized face and hair type.  I repeated the frill from Kurami's dress onto Karakasa along with mirroring the look her her eye onto him to make them look like they truely belong together.  I also kept the dark, elegant feel of the charater into the color scheme playing with violets, pinks, and grey. I also kept this same scheme for Karakasa again to keep them as one character.
